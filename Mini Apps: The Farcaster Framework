Mini Apps (formerly Frames v2) are web applications built using standard technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and enhanced by Farcasterâ€™s SDK. They offer:

Native-like UX: Apps feel integrated into the Farcaster client.
Wallet Connectivity: Users can perform Ethereum-based transactions directly in-feed.
Social Graph Access: Apps can personalize experiences using cast data, reactions, and user profiles.
Notifications & Retention: Developers can re-engage users with mobile alerts and persistent app states. [docs.neynar.com]

ENB leverages these features to create a sticky, rewarding experience for users, often tied to onchain actions like minting or staking.
